# Bayesian Rule Learning
Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) is a rule learning algorithm that searches over a space of Bayesian networks, and infers explicit propositional rules from the optimal Bayesian network. For explanation of the algorithm please read references [1,2,3].

## Usage
To learn how to use BRL classifiers for your data, please refer to the test files. To understand how to run ayesian Rule Learning algorithm, please refer test file: org.probe.rls.test.algo.TestBayesianRuleLearning.java which shows how to use BRL with local structure search [2]. To understand how to run Ensemble Bayesian Rule Learning algorithms, please see test file: org.probe.rls.test.algo.TestEnsembleBayesianRuleLearning.java.
